## üí° The Idea

Salve is a website that allows teachers and students to start classes more easily. Teachers can create a meeting on the website which tracks the arrival of students into their class. Students will go up to the computer and scan their IDs by holding up to the camera, and the system will log their name, time they enter into the meeting, and whether or not they were late based on that. The inspiration behind this project is seeing many minutes of class time wasted on role calls and determining who is absent or late. The world is shifting to modern technology, so why are we still waiting for students to respond "here"?

## ü•Ö Goal

We want to cut the time it takes for classes to get started by removing the delays of attendance. By saving two minutes of class each day, we can save eight classes' worth of learning each school year, essential time. When we brainstormed Salve, we wanted to limit human interaction while maintaining efficiency. We decided that scanning a code is far more efficient than entering data, and wanted to implement a system that stores IDs and students' names making it easier for the teachers to determine who was present.
